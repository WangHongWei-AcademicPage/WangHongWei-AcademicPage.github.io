        LeanCat: A Benchmark Suite for Formal Category Theory in Lean (Part I: 1-Categories)
      </a>
    </h3>

  </div>

  <p class="writing-description">
    This work introduces <strong>LeanCat</strong>, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate automated
    theorem provers on <strong>formalized category theory</strong> within the Lean 4 / mathlib ecosystem.
    Unlike existing benchmarks that focus primarily on olympiad-style or computation-heavy problems,
    LeanCat targets <strong>library-grounded, abstraction-intensive reasoning</strong>, reflecting the way
    modern mathematics is organized and formalized.
  </p>

  <p class="writing-description">
    The benchmark consists of <strong>100 fully formalized theorem statements</strong> covering core areas
    of 1-category theory, including adjunctions, limits and colimits, abelian categories, and monads.
    Each problem is curated from standard references and research-level sources, and annotated with
    difficulty labels through a combined <strong>human expert and LLM-assisted evaluation pipeline</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="writing-description">
    Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art large language models achieve low
    success rates on LeanCat, highlighting a significant gap between natural-language reasoning and
    <strong>robust, research-level formalization</strong>. This work aims to serve as a reusable checkpoint
    for tracking progress in formal mathematics, proof engineering, and AI-assisted theorem proving.

    <h3 class="writing-title"><a href="../assets/Galois_Connection.pdf">A Unifying Framework of Galois Connections: From Adjoint Functors to Galois Theory and Topological Covering Spaces</a></h3>
    <div class="writing-meta">Dec 2025</div>
  </div>
  <p class="writing-description">
    This work establishes a <strong>unified categorical perspective</strong> on two classical correspondence theorems: the <strong>fundamental theorem of Galois theory</strong> and the <strong>corresponding of covering spaces with its fundamental groups</strong>. Beginning with the order-theoretic concept of <strong>Galois connections</strong> between partially ordered sets, the paper demonstrates how this notion naturally categorifies to the theory of <strong>adjoint functors</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="writing-description">
    The core contribution shows how both <strong>Galois theory</strong> in algebra and <strong>covering space classification theorem</strong> in topology emerge as concrete instances of the same abstract adjunction. The work bridges these seemingly distinct mathematical domains through the common language of <strong>category theory</strong>, making the structural parallels explicit and rigorously formalized. Accessible to undergraduates with basic knowledge of abstract algebra and algebraic topology, the paper includes a self-contained introduction to the necessary categorical foundations.

      <div class="writing-meta">In Progress</div>
    </div>
    <p class="writing-description">This work introduces the fundamental concepts of <strong>algebraic topology</strong> from a <strong>categorical perspective</strong>, providing a natural motivation for the study of <strong>homotopy theory</strong>. It builds a bridge between <strong>fundamental groups</strong> and <strong>fundamental groupoids</strong>, concretely demonstrated by proving the categorical equivalence of the <strong>van Kampen theorem</strong> under its colimit formulations for groupoids versus groups. The work further categorifies <strong>covering space theory</strong>, establishing an isomorphism between the fundamental groupoids of covering spaces and the structures of <strong>Galois theory</strong>, thereby deepening the categorical language of algebraic topology. It also provides an introduction to <strong>homotopy theory</strong> and <strong>homotopy type theory</strong>, undertaking initial steps in formalizing some of these foundations using the <strong>Lean theorem prover</strong>.</p>

      <div class="writing-meta">May 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p class="writing-description">This work entailed a study and deep dive into <strong>fractal constructions</strong> and the definition and computation of <strong>Hausdorff dimension</strong>. It introduced the concept of fractal dimension through the classic historical problem of <strong>coastline measurement</strong> and employed <strong>Iterated Function Systems (IFS)</strong> to construct fractals, thereby introducing the concept of a <strong>fractal generating group</strong>. By analyzing geometric structures through algebraic methods, it culminated in a conjecture relating the <strong>lower bound of a fractal's Hausdorff dimension</strong> to the <strong>order of its generating group</strong>, attempting to build a bridge between <strong>fractal geometry</strong> and <strong>algebra</strong>.</p>

      <div class="writing-meta">April 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p class="writing-description">This project explored a method of assisting mathematical learning through <strong>AI-generated code</strong>. By formulating precise prompts based on specific problems, I designed and implemented simple <strong>Python programs</strong> to deepen the understanding of abstract concepts. Key implementations include: a <strong>machine learning model</strong> to analyze winning strategies in the K₅ graph game related to <strong>Ramsey's Theorem</strong>; a <strong>2D visualization tool</strong> for holomorphic functions in four dimensions with automatic singularity detection; and a program that visualizes <strong>scalar fields</strong> and automatically computes and plots their corresponding <strong>gradient vector fields</strong>. The inspiration for all programs stemmed from challenges encountered in coursework, and their development significantly enhanced my comprehension of the underlying mathematical theory.</p>

      <div class="writing-meta">March 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p class="writing-description">As a student teaching assistant, I created and delivered a lecture based on a <strong>group theory permutation problem</strong> from the animated series Futurama, specifically the "mind-switching" dilemma. This approach was designed to help students new to <strong>abstract algebra</strong> deepen their understanding of <strong>group structures</strong> and <strong>permutations</strong>. The lecture included a full solution to the problem and concluded with a related exercise for further student practice.</p>

    <p class="writing-description">A large-scale visualization project on <strong>prime number spirals</strong>. Utilizing <strong>Python</strong>, it generates <strong>Sacks, Ulam, and other prime spirals</strong> over extensive numerical ranges to investigate prime distribution patterns at a large scale and analyze their underlying structures.

    <p class="writing-description">These are comprehensive study notes on Tom Apostol's <strong>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</strong>. They meticulously document all essential <strong>arithmetic functions</strong> used in the field and cover classic theorems on the <strong>distribution of prime numbers</strong>. The notes serve as a dictionary of analytic number theory functions, providing detailed definitions and explanations for each.
