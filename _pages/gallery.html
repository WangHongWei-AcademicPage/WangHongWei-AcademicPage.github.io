<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2em; font-style: italic; color: #2c3e50;">This is not a typical success story. This is a confession—a record of how a humanities student who once wandered through history and politics found himself unexpectedly captivated by the absolute beauty of pure mathematics, embarking on a path of no return.</p>

      <strong>I remember standing at the university gate, filled with uncertainty.</strong> Having suspended my studies for a year and immersed in the humanities, mathematics felt like a foreign language to me. My father, a computer science Ph.D., walked beside me—his presence both comforting and intimidating. <em>"Maybe I'll just get through this,"</em> I thought, never imagining that behind these gates awaited a revolution that would shatter and rebuild my entire worldview.

      <strong>They say you never truly understand something until you teach it. So I chose to teach the one subject that terrified me most: Linear Algebra.</strong> The night before my first lecture, I almost backed out. <em>"What if I fail? What if they see through my facade?"</em> But as I stood before my peers, explaining row reduction and vector spaces, something miraculous happened—the fog began to lift. <strong>In the process of deconstructing knowledge for others, I discovered a profound truth: the elegance of algebraic structures spoke to me in a way no historical narrative ever had.</strong> This wasn't just teaching; this was my mathematical awakening.

      <strong>Standing at the astronomy conference, surrounded by brilliant physicists, I felt like an imposter.</strong> Professor Pang had given me everything—Python skills, research training, a path forward. Yet as I listened to talks about cosmic phenomena, my mind kept wandering back to the mathematical structures underlying them. <strong>The equations fascinated me more than their physical interpretations.</strong> That night, staring at the starry sky, I made the most difficult decision of my academic life: to abandon the security of applied research and pursue the treacherous path of pure mathematics. <em>I was choosing beauty over utility, abstraction over application.</em>

      <strong>The moment I understood Galois theory, I felt like I had discovered a secret language of the universe.</strong> While my peers struggled with the abstraction, I found myself intoxicated by it. Teaching commutative algebra became not just a duty, but a joy. <strong>Each lecture felt like unveiling a masterpiece—group theory's symmetry, field extensions' elegance, the heartbreaking genius of Galois' short life.</strong> One evening, after explaining the unsolvability of the quintic, a student asked, <em>"But what's the practical use of this?"</em> I smiled and replied, <em>"Some beauty needs no justification."</em> In that moment, I knew: <strong>I was no longer studying mathematics; I had become a mathematician.</strong>

      <strong>Listening to Professor Zhang recount his decades of solitary pursuit, I saw my future—and it terrified me.</strong> As he described working in isolation, driven only by mathematical intuition, I remembered my own lonely nights plotting prime number spirals, searching for patterns that might not even exist. <strong>His story wasn't just inspirational; it was a warning.</strong> Mathematics demands everything—your time, your relationships, your very identity. Walking back to my dorm, the weight of this realization crushed me. <em>Was I prepared for such solitude? Did I possess that kind of courage?</em> The prime numbers on my screen seemed to mock my uncertainty.

      <strong>If the path didn't exist, I would build it myself.</strong> Frustrated by the lack of pure mathematics community, I decided to create one. Sending those first invitation emails felt more daunting than any exam. <em>"Who would come? Was I qualified to lead this?"</em> But as the room filled with curious faces, something shifted. <strong>Standing there, explaining Galois' genius to students from different backgrounds, I realized this was my answer to the solitude.</strong> We weren't just sharing knowledge; we were building a sanctuary for those who saw beauty in abstraction. Looking at the engaged audience, I understood: <strong>my journey was no longer about personal achievement, but about creating spaces where mathematical beauty could flourish.</strong>
