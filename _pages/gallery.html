<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2em;">This gallery chronicles my mathematical journey since the beginning of university. <strong>From a high school humanities student—who suspended studies for a year and later focused on politics, history, and geography—to now standing at the crossroads of life as a final-year student, unwavering and carrying the dream of becoming a pure mathematician.</strong> University has offered me more than academic growth; it has been a quest to discover a lifelong passion and innate calling. <strong>These moments are preserved here: this is my path in pure mathematics—a path of purity.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>My father accompanied me to XJTLU, which is thousands of kilometers away from our hometown, to help me settle in.</strong> As a Ph.D. in Computer Science, he has always been a great source of academic guidance and inspiration for me.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>A strategic decision during my freshman year proved transformative: as a new student lecturer, I chose to teach Linear Algebra precisely because it was my weaker subject, forcing me to master it thoroughly.</strong> The review series I subsequently created was met with widespread student praise and became the most-watched content on the Math Society's channel. <strong>More importantly, this process of teaching and deep engagement with the material cemented my affinity for algebraic structures, fundamentally directing my academic trajectory toward algebra.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Under Professor Pang's mentorship, I acquired foundational Python programming skills during my freshman year.</strong> As a member of the research group, I received systematic research guidance and training, which laid the groundwork for my future path in research. <strong>It was also during this period that I profoundly realized the fundamental distinction between physics and mathematics.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>As I delved deeper into my undergraduate mathematics studies, I increasingly found that, compared to the rigorous mystique of analysis, I was more drawn to the elegance and structured nature of algebra.</strong> Gradually, I embarked on a path dedicated to pure mathematics with a focus on algebra. <strong>Serving as the student lecturer for algebra at my university, I continually refined my understanding through teaching.</strong> From Advanced Linear Algebra and Abstract Algebra to Commutative Algebra and Galois Theory, my direction in pure mathematics crystallized, and I came to a profound realization: <strong>my goal is to become a pure mathematician.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>During my research on large-scale prime number visualization under Professor Pietro, I had the privilege of attending a lecture by Professor Yitang Zhang on his landmark work regarding the bounded gaps of prime numbers.</strong> He recounted his decades-long solitary pursuit—how he withdrew from the world, driven by an almost obsessive conviction and the purest intuition for mathematics, until he finally overcame this millennia-old challenge. <strong>His story served as a mirror, reflecting my own experience: those days and nights I spent plotting prime spirals and searching for their macroscopic patterns made me feel the same insignificance and solitude one faces before the vast universe of mathematics.</strong> At that moment, I came to a profound realization—<strong>from Professor Zhang's extraordinary solitary courage, to every mathematics student's lonely struggle with difficult problems deep into the night—mathematics has always been an arduous and solitary journey.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>In the winter of my junior year, I galvanized fellow students within the School of Mathematics and Physics who shared a passion for pure mathematics, creating a platform for us to share our knowledge.</strong> I single-handedly managed all speaker invitations and promotional efforts. <strong>My own role was to lecture on Galois theory, tracing its historical motivation to the unsolvability of the quintic by radicals.</strong> I was profoundly impressed by the sheer beauty of its symmetric structures and the undeniable genius of Galois himself. <strong>It was immensely rewarding to see the initiative receive widespread participation and strong support.</strong> Furthermore, the seminar successfully cultivated a cross-disciplinary learning environment, allowing participants to gain exposure to mathematical fields outside their own specialties.</p>
