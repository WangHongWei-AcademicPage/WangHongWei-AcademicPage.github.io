<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2em;">This gallery chronicles my mathematical journey since the beginning of university. <strong>From a high school humanities student—who suspended studies for a year and later focused on politics, history, and geography—to now standing at the crossroads of life as a final-year student, unwavering and carrying the dream of becoming a pure mathematician.</strong> University has offered me more than academic growth; it has been a quest to discover a lifelong passion and innate calling. <strong>These moments are preserved here: this is my path in pure mathematics—a path of purity.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>A strategic decision during my freshman year proved transformative: as a new student lecturer, I chose to teach Linear Algebra precisely because it was my weaker subject, forcing me to master it thoroughly.</strong> The review series I subsequently created was met with widespread student praise and became the most-watched content on the Math Society's channel. <strong>More importantly, this process of teaching and deep engagement with the material cemented my affinity for algebraic structures, fundamentally directing my academic trajectory toward algebra.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Under Professor Pang's mentorship, I acquired foundational Python programming skills during my freshman year.</strong> As a member of the research group, I received systematic research guidance and training, which laid the groundwork for my future path in research. <strong>It was also during this period that I profoundly realized the fundamental distinction between physics and mathematics.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>During my research on large-scale prime number visualization under Professor Pietro, I had the privilege of attending a lecture by Professor Yitang Zhang on his landmark work regarding the bounded gaps of prime numbers.</strong> He recounted his decades-long solitary pursuit—how he withdrew from the world, driven by an almost obsessive conviction and the purest intuition for mathematics, until he finally overcame this millennia-old challenge. <strong>His story served as a mirror, reflecting my own experience: those days and nights I spent plotting prime spirals and searching for their macroscopic patterns made me feel the same insignificance and solitude one faces before the vast universe of mathematics.</strong> At that moment, I came to a profound realization—<strong>from Professor Zhang's extraordinary solitary courage, to every mathematics student's lonely struggle with difficult problems deep into the night—mathematics has always been an arduous and solitary journey.</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>In the winter of my junior year, I galvanized fellow students within the School of Mathematics and Physics who shared a passion for pure mathematics, creating a platform for us to share our knowledge.</strong> I single-handedly managed all speaker invitations and promotional efforts. <strong>My own role was to lecture on Galois theory, tracing its historical motivation to the unsolvability of the quintic by radicals.</strong> I was profoundly impressed by the sheer beauty of its symmetric structures and the undeniable genius of Galois himself. <strong>It was immensely rewarding to see the initiative receive widespread participation and strong support.</strong> Furthermore, the seminar successfully cultivated a cross-disciplinary learning environment, allowing participants to gain exposure to mathematical fields outside their own specialties.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>When I heard that Professor Adam was organizing an undergraduate seminar on category theory, I immediately scoured the internet and the library for introductions and textbooks on the subject. The moment I grasped that category theory is "the discipline that studies all mathematical objects and the mappings between them as a unified whole. Its core focus is not on the 'internal' structure of objects, but on the 'relationships' between objects," I was thrilled. This was the mathematics of my ideals, perfectly aligning with my vision of mathematical unity and structural relations. I then realized that my previous understanding of the motivation behind group homomorphisms—"when a problem is difficult to solve in one context, we construct a bridge via homomorphisms to discuss it in another, more transparent context"—was merely a glimpse into the ideas of categories and functors! Without hesitation, I joined the seminar and proactively took on the role of a primary presenter.
When the seminar progressed to representable functors and the Yoneda lemma, I couldn't help but marvel: "The Yoneda Lemma fundamentally reveals that an object is essentially uniquely determined by its relationships with all other objects." This was not merely a technical lemma; it was a profound philosophy: mathematical reality is not composed of isolated 'things,' but is defined by the 'network of interactions' between them. From that point on, I resolved to advance further on this ideal mathematical path of category theory. This decision also set the stage for my subsequent deep dive into algebraic topology and homotopy theory, where I would employ the language of categories to comprehend the grand landscape of topological spaces and homotopy invariants.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>My proficiency and passion in algebra have been widely recognized within the School. After serving as a Student Lecturer and Academic Navigator, I was appointed as an Algebra Teaching Assistant, responsible for supporting the teaching of second-year Abstract Algebra.
I deeply valued this opportunity. Every week, I dedicated time at the School's Help Center, assisting younger students with their algebra questions and guiding them toward a solid understanding of abstract algebraic concepts.
Additionally, I took the initiative to design and write up challenging problems, publishing them on the university's platform. It brought me immense satisfaction whenever a student would approach me, excited to share that they had successfully solved one of my puzzles.</p>
