    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">My father accompanied me to XJTLU, which is thousands of kilometers away from our hometown, to help me settle in. As a Ph.D. in Computer Science, he has always been a great source of academic guidance and inspiration for me.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1em; color: #34495e; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">Under Professor Pang's mentorship, I acquired foundational Python programming skills during my freshman year. As a member of the research group, I received systematic research guidance and training, which laid the groundwork for my future path in research. It was also during this period that I profoundly realized the fundamental distinction between physics and mathematics.</p>
