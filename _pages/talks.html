<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2em;">This page showcases my academic presentations, seminars, and summer school engagements. You will find a brief introduction for each item below. If any presentation piques your interest, please feel free to watch the related video via the provided link.<br><br>
All videos are also synchronized to my social media account, so you can also view the content directly on my platform. You can visit my <strong>Bilibili homepage</strong> here: <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/366692478?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0">https://space.bilibili.com/366692478</a>. I currently do not maintain separate YouTube or other platform accounts for sharing academic content. Should I decide to create additional platform accounts in the future, I will update the links here accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
