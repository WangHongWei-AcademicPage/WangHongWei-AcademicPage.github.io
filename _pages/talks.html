  <p><strong>Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</strong></p>
  <p>This seminar delved into the foundational concepts of representable functors and the profound Yoneda Lemma, which stands as a cornerstone of category theory. The discussion illuminated how representable functors bridge abstract categorical structures with concrete sets of morphisms, providing a powerful tool for understanding mathematical objects through their relationships. The Yoneda Lemma was explored in depth, demonstrating its remarkable implication that an object is entirely determined by its interactions with all other objects in the category, thereby offering a fundamentally relational perspective on mathematical entities.</p>

  <p><strong>Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</strong></p>
  <p>An in-depth exploration of Galois theory, focusing on the fundamental connection between field extensions and group theory. This seminar covered the core principles of polynomial roots, field automorphisms, and the celebrated Galois correspondence, which establishes a beautiful duality between subfields and subgroups. The discussion extended to the insolvability of the quintic equation by radicals, demonstrating the power of Galois theory in resolving classical problems in algebra.</p>
