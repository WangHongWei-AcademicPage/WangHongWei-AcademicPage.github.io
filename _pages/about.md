I'm a year 4 undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/study/departments/school-of-mathematics-and-physics), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University(XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/). 

As a pure mathematics student, I focus on Algebraic Topology and Homotopy Theory, with extending interests in Homotopy Type Theory and formal verification of mathematics using the Lean Theorem Prover.
