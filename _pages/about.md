I'm a year 4 undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/study/departments/school-of-mathematics-and-physics), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University(XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/). 

As a pure mathematics student, I focus on Algebraic Topology and Homotopy Theory, with extending interests in Homotopy Type Theory and formal verification of mathematics using the Lean Theorem Prover.

## Academic Experience

### Research Assistant in Categorical Algebra & Homotopy Theory
**Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University** | *Sep 2025 - Expected Jun 2026*  
*Advisor: Prof. Alastair Darby*

- Spearheaded a research project bridging category theory, algebraic topology, and formal verification.
- Formalized core theorems of algebraic topology in **Lean**, including a complete proof of π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ, exploring the profound connection between homotopy theory and dependent type theory.
- Established deep categorical insights by proving the equivalence between the van Kampen theorem and its formulation via categorical colimits in groupoids.
- Developed a unified mathematical perspective by framing the Galois theory of covering spaces within a categorical framework, linking topological and algebraic constructs.
- Solidified expertise through systematic study of fundamental groups, covering spaces, simplicial homology, and homotopy theory.



### Visiting Scholar in Algebraic Topology
**Westlake University** | *Sep 2025 - Expected Mar 2026*  
*Advisor: Prof. Xing Gu*

- Engaged in graduate-level studies by attending Prof. Gu's advanced algebraic topology seminar weekly, deepening theoretical understanding.
- Conducted self-directed thesis research on modern algebraic topology, utilizing Haynes Miller's notes to master simplicial homology and homotopy theory with a focus on their categorical foundations.



### Participant, Global Mathematics Students' Summer School
**Westlake University** | *Jun 2025 - Jul 2025*  
*Organizer: Prof. Huayi Chen*

- Immersed in an intensive program featuring daily discussions on advanced topics including **information geometry**, **algebraic geometry**, **algebraic number theory**, **elliptic PDE regularity theory**, and the **analytic/arithmetic properties of modular forms**.
- Synthesized complex material by compiling detailed notes and cross-topic summaries, facilitating the construction of a robust, interdisciplinary knowledge framework.



### Lecturer & Organizer, Undergraduate Category Theory Seminar
**Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University** | *Feb 2025 - May 2025*  
*Organizer: Prof. Adam-Chrisiaan von*

- Mastered advanced category theory concepts including limits, representable functors, and the Yoneda lemma.
- Designed and delivered a special lecture for peers, elucidating abstract concepts like representable functors and the Yoneda lemma through concrete examples from algebra (e.g., group actions) and topology (e.g., the category of presheaves).



### Summer Research Fellow in Analytic Number Theory
**Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University** | *Jun 2024 - Sep 2024*  
*Advisor: Prof. Pietro Sgobba*

- Conducted an in-depth study of Tom M. Apostol's *Introduction to Analytic Number Theory*, mastering arithmetical functions, Chebyshev estimates, and elementary forms of the Prime Number Theorem.
- Authored a comprehensive review paper titled *"Arithmetical Functions and Elementary Theorems on the Distribution of Primes"*.
- Programmed visualizations in **Python** to generate prime number spirals (Ulam, Klauber, Sacks) and investigated prime-rich polynomials.

## Interdisciplinary Projects

### Workshop Member: AI in Mathematics Learning
**Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University** | *Oct 2024 - Apr 2025*  
*Advisor: Prof. Jinsong Xu*

- Led a six-month empirical study on applying generative programming to pure mathematics (**complex analysis**, **abstract algebra**, **topology**).
- Developed and presented three interactive learning tools:
    1.  A machine-learning proof for a simple case of **Ramsey's Theorem** on K₅.
    2.  A visualization tool for **conformal mappings** with automatic singularity detection.
    3.  A scalar field visualization program that computes and plots gradient vectors.
- Authored and presented the research report *"AI-Driven Python Code Generation for Solving Specific Mathematics Problems"*, receiving positive recognition.



### Research Assistant: Data-Driven Astronomy
**Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University** | *Oct 2022 - Jun 2023*  
*Advisor: Prof. Xiaoying Pang*

- Processed and analyzed the high-dimensional **Gaia DR3** star catalog using **Python**.
- Applied a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for initial member star screening of the **Beehive Cluster**.
- Innovatively implemented a **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)** for unsupervised clustering, identifying 387 high-confidence member stars and producing a clear color-magnitude diagram (CMD).
