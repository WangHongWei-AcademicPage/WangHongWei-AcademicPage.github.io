I'm a year 4 undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/study/departments/school-of-mathematics-and-physics), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/). As a pure mathematics student, I focus on Algebraic Topology and Homotopy Theory, with extending interests in Homotopy Type Theory and formal verification of mathematics using the Lean Theorem Prover.

For further information, you can find my CV here: [Hongwei.Wang CV, 11/09/25 updated](../assets/CV.pdf). The attached document is a reverse-chronological summary of my study. For a detailed narrative of my study and experiences, please just read the content in this website.
