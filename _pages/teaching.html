<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2em;">As a <strong>student teaching assistant</strong> in the Pure Mathematics division at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, I was responsible for teaching MTH122 Abstract Algebra. Additionally, as an <strong>Academic Navigator</strong> in the School of Mathematics and Physics, I regularly conducted knowledge consolidation lectures and provided academic support to fellow students. Prior to these roles, I served as a <strong>lecturer for the XJTLU Mathematics Society</strong>, delivering algebra midterm and final review sessions for all mathematics majors.<br><br>
I have always adhered to the learning philosophy that "the best way to truly understand a problem is to explain it clearly to others," and I have greatly benefited from this output-oriented approach to learning. You can explore all my undergraduate teaching engagements on this page.</p>
