    <p>As a <strong>student teaching assistant</strong> in the Pure Mathematics department of School of Mathematics and Physics, XJTLU, I was responsible for teaching MTH122 Abstract Algebra. Additionally, as an <strong>Academic Navigator</strong> in the School of Mathematics and Physics, I regularly conducted knowledge consolidation lectures and provided academic support to fellow students. Prior to these roles, I served as a <strong>lecturer for the XJTLU Mathematics Club</strong>, delivering algebra midterm and final review sessions for all mathematics majors.</p>
    
    <p>I have always adhered to the learning philosophy that <strong>"the best way to truly understand a problem is to explain it clearly to others"</strong>, and I have greatly benefited from this output-oriented approach to learning. You can explore all my undergraduate teaching engagements on this page.</p>
