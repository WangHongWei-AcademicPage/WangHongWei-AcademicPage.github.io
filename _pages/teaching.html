<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2em;">As a <strong>student teaching assistant</strong> in the Pure Mathematics department of School of Mathematics and Physics, XJTLU, I was responsible for teaching MTH122 Abstract Algebra. Additionally, as an <strong>Academic Navigator</strong> in the School of Mathematics and Physics, I regularly conducted knowledge consolidation lectures and provided academic support to fellow students. Prior to these roles, I served as a <strong>lecturer for the XJTLU Mathematics Society</strong>, delivering algebra midterm and final review sessions for all mathematics majors.<br><br>
I have always adhered to the learning philosophy that <strong>"the best way to truly understand a problem is to explain it clearly to others"</strong>, and I have greatly benefited from this output-oriented approach to learning. You can explore all my undergraduate teaching engagements on this page.</p>

    <p><strong>School of Mathematics and Physics, XJTLU</strong> | <em>10/2022 - 06/2024</em></p>
    <p>As a Student Lecturer, I organized comprehensive review sessions for the entire mathematics student cohort. Focusing on the algebra stream, I conducted lectures for Linear Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, and Abstract Algebra to prepare students for their midterm and final examinations. The sessions were designed to reinforce difficult concepts and solidify semester-long learning.</p>
